**Overview:**

An app in which user have to answer to 5 questions that are generated using [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

After clicking "Start quiz" button user gets random questions and able to select only 1 answer in each section.
After selecting/refusing to select the answers and clicking "Check answers" button user is able to see the correct answers. 
After that user is prompted to start over by clicking "Play again" button

**Technical difficulties:**

As it was my first React.js project that I had to do completely from scratch there were a number of technical difficulties 
that I had to overcome in order to implement a viable solution. By trial and error I built everything step by step and overcome all the difficulties in the process.

By far the most confusing and trickiest parts were:
* Building up necessary components logic and interaction using props and callbacks
* Mixing up a correct answer with incorrect ones
* Applying necessary styles and count correct answers after clicking "Check answers" button
